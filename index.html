      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Jameson, and I’ve been with Power for 3+ years now, all coming in the Contact Center. I started at Inside Sales, moved to Customer Care, and currently with Sales Desk (aka Appointment Support). I was in hospitality for 20 years before coming to power… the pandemic may have played a hand in that move. From Olive Garden in Lincoln, NE to Di Bruno Bros in Philadelphia, PA; I’ve seen a lot. The office life isn’t so bad.</p>
      <p>When I’m out of office, I like to travel, go bowling, play tennis, and sometimes couch. RIP Laney, our couch's best friend. In the last year I’ve been to the Dominican Republic, Yosemite and Tahoe, Ohio (Hawking Hills is worth looking into), and Hilton Head, South Carolina. My partner and I are avid bowlers when we’re in town, as we are from the Midwest. Never thrown a perfect 300, but I’ve gotten 268 once… just once.</p>
      <p>Outside of a life of leisure at home, I’m looking to challenge myself with the Code Academy, as the daily Wordle isn’t challenging enough for me. Looking forward to the journey!</p>
